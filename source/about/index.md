Hello everybody 👏🏻 and welcome to my blog !!

My name is Claudio and I'm a DevOps/SRE/Cloud Engineer .. (whatever) who loves to automating things nd implement workflows integrating different technologies.

I’ll share with you what I’m learning because I believe in learning in public, building a feedback loop and establishing a community.

So resuming my interest areas, it’d be something like that:

- Orchestration with Kubernetes, IaC with Terraform and Automation (CI/CD, workflows or scripts).
- Cool cloud implementations. ☁
- [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) tools like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com), [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) or [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron)
- Workflows of capturing information into **Zettelkasten** with multiple processing and automation tools like [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u), [Readwise](https://readwise.io), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), IOS Shortcuts, [The Rip](http://the.rip/), etc
- Stocks, options, swing trading.
- New interesting tools, books or articles.

About my hobbies I can list:

- Futbol !! ⚽. I love to play and to watch games and play Fantasy PL.
- I'm very interested in Astrophotography  🚀 but right now I'm a newbie.
- Poker (I played online more than 1.000.000 hands where I was finishing my college 50 -> 70k USD)
- Home automation
- Quantified self
