Hello everybody 👏🏻 and welcome to my blog !!

My name is Claudio and I'm a DevOps/SRE/Cloud Engineer .. (whatever) who loves to automating things.

I'll share with you what I'm learning because I believe in learn in public building a feedback loop and establishing a community.

I'm a very curious person so trying to synthetize my areas of interest it'd be something like that:

- Automation (CI/CD, workflows or scripts)
- Orchestration with Kubernetes.
- IaC with Terraform.
- New interesting tools, books or articles.
-
